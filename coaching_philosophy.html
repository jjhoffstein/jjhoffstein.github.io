							<h1>My Coaching Philosphy</h1>
							<p>Everyone has their "one quote" that they live by. Mine is this one, from Super-Bowl-winning head coach Tony Dungy:</p>
							<blockquote>The secret to success is good leadership, and good leadership is all about making the lives of your team members better.</blockquote>
							<p>This is what drives me, and this is why I got into coaching: <i>to help make the lives of my team members better</i>.</p>
							<p>With Coach Dungy's quote as my guiding light, I developed my coaching philosophy to help chart the course for my coaching journey. Its purpose is to (1) articulate my goals, and (2) let you know how I plan to achieve those goals.</p>
							<p>In one sentence, my coaching philosophy is: </p>
							<blockquote>I aim to foster <b>student-athlete success</b> by building a <b>strong team culture</b> where the goals are <b>meaningful work</b> and <b>meaningful relationships</b> achieved through core values of <b>truth</b>, <b>love</b>, and <b>attention</b>.</blockquote>
							<p>The details of this coaching philosophy can be found below:</p>
							<h2>I aim to foster <b>Student-Athlete Success</b></h2>
							<ul>
								<li>Success is defined as improvement over time, i.e. "success is a journey".</li>
								<li>Success includes "the whole person", not just the athlete.</li>
								<li>Athletic success occurs alongside academic success.</li>
							</ul>
							<h2>By building a <b>Strong Team Culture</b></h2>
							<ul>
								<li>We put the team's goals before our own.</li>
								<li>We have fun competing together.</li>
								<li>Learning through failure is celebrated and encouraged.</li>
							</ul>
							<h2>Goal #1: Meaningful Work</h2>
							<ul>
								<li>We become a true team on a mission together.</li>
								<li>Practices are challenging and engaging.</li>
								<li>The work brings out our best selves.</li>
							</ul>
							<h2>Goal #2: Meaningful Relationships</h2>
							<ul>
								<li>We value our relationships more than we value our win-loss record.</li>
								<li>We stick by each other through thick and thin.</li>
								<li>We want what's best for one another.</li>
							</ul>
							<h2>Core Value #1: Truth</h2>
							<ul>
								<li>We put our honest thoughts on the table; we are transparent with each other.</li>
								<li>We both envy and strive to maintain individual integrity.</li>
								<li>We believe that having individual integrity leads to mutual trust which provides an optimal environment for improvement over time.</li>
							</ul>
							<h2>Core Value #2: Love</h2>
							<ul>
								<li>We strive to respond in a loving fashion no matter the situation.</li>
								<li>We treat others the way we want to be treated.</li>
								<li>We celebrate each other's successes.</li>							
							</ul>
							<h2>Core Value #3: Attention</h2>
							<ul>
								<li>We value the ability to pay attention above all other skills.</li>
								<li>We stay curious about the things that will make us better.</li>
								<li>We focus on things that other teams normally take for granted, which gives us a competitive edge.</li>
							</ul>

							<p>The above summarizes by coaching philosophy. If you'd like to learn more, I do maintain a more comprehensive document of the "Principles" I live by which can be found <a href="files/Principles_Website_Version.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><i class="fas fa-file-pdf"></i> View Principles Document</a>.</p>
