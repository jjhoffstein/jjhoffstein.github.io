							<h1>My Coaching Philosphy</h1>
							<p>Everyone has their one quote that they live by. Mine is this one, from Super-Bowl-winning head coach Tony Dungy:</p>
							<blockquote>The secret to success is good leadership, and good leadership is all about making the lives of your team members better.</blockquote>
							<p>This is what drives me, and this is why I got into coaching: <i>to help make the lives of my team members better</i>.</p>
							<p>With Coach Dungy's quote as my guiding light, I developed my coaching philosophy to help chart the course for my coaching journey. Its purpose is to (1) articulate my goals, and (2) let you know how I plan to achieve those goals.</p>
							<p>After many iterations, I managed to boil down my coaching philosophy into one single sentence. That sentence is: </p>
							<blockquote>I aim to foster <b>student-athlete success</b> by building a <b>culture of basketball excellence</b> where the goals are <b>meaningful work</b> and <b>meaningful relationships</b> achieved through core values of <b>truth</b>, <b>love</b>, and <b>attention</b>.</blockquote>
							<p>The bullets below will help you better understand each element of my coaching philosophy. Although the bullets are not fully comprehensive, I hope they will give you a better sense of what my coaching philosophy is all about.</p>
							<h2>My aim is to foster <b>Student-Athlete Success</b></h2>
							<ul>
								<li>Success is defined as improvement over time, i.e. “success is a journey”.</li>
								<li>Success includes “the whole person”, not just the athlete.</li>
								<li>Athletic success will not take precedence over academic success; students will be provided with the conditions to be successful at both.</li>
							</ul>
							<h2>By Building a <b>Culture of Basketball Excellence</b></h2>
							<ul>
								<li>We care about being great and strive to discover our best selves.</li>
								<li>Learning through failure is celebrated and encouraged.</li>
								<li>We hold each other accountable to high standards of behavior.</li>
							</ul>
							<h2>Goal #1: Meaningful Work</h2>
							<ul>
								<li>We become a true team on a mission together.</li>
								<li>Practices are challenging but also fun.</li>
								<li>We improve as people, not just as basketball players.</li>
							</ul>
							<h2>Goal #2: Meaningful Relationships</h2>
							<ul>
								<li>We value our relationships much more than we value our win-loss record.</li>
								<li>We stick by each other through thick and thin.</li>
								<li>We maintain mutual care and respect for each other.</li>
							</ul>
							<h2>Core Value #1: Truth</h2>
							<ul>
								<li>We put our honest thoughts on the table; we are transparent with each other.</li>
								<li>We both envy and strive to maintain individual integrity.</li>
								<li>We believe that having individual integrity leads to mutual trust which provides an optimal environment for improvement over time.</li>
							</ul>
							<h2>Core Value #2: Love</h2>
							<ul>
								<li>We strive to respond in a loving fashion no matter the situation.</li>
								<li>We treat others the way we want to be treated.</li>
								<li>We recognize that whereas trust must be earned, love is something that can be freely given.</li>							</ul>
							<h2>Core Value #3: Attention</h2>
							<ul>
								<li>We value the ability to pay attention above all other skills.</li>
								<li>We stay curious about the things that will make us better.</li>
								<li>We focus on things that other teams normally take for granted, which gives us a tremendous competitive advantage.</li>
							</ul>
							<h2>One picture; one sentence:</h2>
							<span class="image main"><img src="images/coaching_philosophy.jpg" alt="" /></span>
							<p>I aim to foster <b>student-athlete success</b> by building a <b>culture of basketball excellence</b> where the goals are <b>meaningful work</b> and <b>meaningful relationships</b> achieved through core values of <b>truth</b>, <b>love</b>, and <b>attention</b>.</p>
							<h2>Further reading:</h2>
							<p>Like I said, the above bullets are not fully comprehensive, but do I hope it gives you some idea of how I think, what my values are, what my program's values will be.</p>
							<p>I do maintain a more comprehensive document of my "Principles" that I live by, which I add to and adjust over time. If you're curious and you'd like to read that document, it's available <a href="files/Principles_Website_Version.docx">here</a>. I hope you like it, and please don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or feedback!</p>
