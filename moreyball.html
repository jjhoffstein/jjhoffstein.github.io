							<h1>Moreyball</h1>
							<span class="image main"><img src="images/Morey formula_L.jpg" alt="" /></span>
							<p>If you're familiar with basketball, you probably know just how much Daryl Morey changed the way the game is played.</p>
							<p>In case you're not familiar, let me explain:</p>
							<p>A long-time basketball executive, Morey's philosophy heavily favors 3pt field goals, layups, and foul shots over mid-range jumpers.</p>
							<p>Morey was so influential in creating this style that they named it after him - it's called "Moreyball".</p>
							<p>My personal conviction is that "Moreyball" should be the preferred playing style at all levels of basketball, not just the NBA.</p>
							<p>I'll use this section to document why I think that, and where in the basketball world I think the playing style arbitrage opportunities are right now.</p>
							<p>Let's get to it:</p>
							<h2>NBA Level</h2>
							<p>At the NBA level, I really can't explain it any better than this graphic from Bo McCready (@boknowsdata) that I found on Reddit:</p>
							<span class="image main"><img src="images/nba_moreyball.png" alt="" /></span>
							<p>The upshot is that NBA teams are shooting way more 3pters than they used to, and as a result their offensive efficiency has improved substantially.</p>
							<p>I also find <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BlQu-V-crI4&t=3m34s">this</a> quote from one of the NBA's best coaches, Rick Carlisle, to be very illuminating:</p>
							<blockquote>The [mid-range jumper] is just not a good play anymore...It's a low-value situation...When any of our guys [attempt mid-range jumpers], our effectiveness is diminished exponentially. It's counter-intuitive, I understand that. But it's a fact.</blockquote>
							<p>I also loved <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a9Pl_v_yqAI&t=2m1s">this</a> exchange between a reporter and NBA head coach Mike D'Antoni after D'Antoni's Rockets lost Game 7 of the Western Conference Finals to a historically great Golden State Warriors team.</p>
							<p>D'Antoni laughs off the reporter's question as to whether losing that game made him lose confidence in the Rockets' strategy of playing Moreyball.</p>
							<p><i>Of course not!</i> he insists. <i>If we weren't playing Moreyball then we wouldn't have made it this far in the first place!</i></p>							
							<h2>WNBA</h2>
							<p>The story really isn't all that different in the WNBA:</p>
							<span class="image main"><img src="images/wnba_new.png" alt="" /></span>
							<p>The above picture was taken from <a href="https://medium.com/her-hoop-stats/the-wnba-is-making-more-3-pointers-than-ever-dffd84290da2">this</a> article from <i>Her Hoop Stats</i> about 3pt trends in the WNBA.</p>
							<p>The trend is clear: WNBA teams are following in NBA teams' lead in attempting more 3pters per game.</p>
							<p>What's more is that even within the WNBA the best teams favor more 3pters compared to mediocre teams.</p>
							<p>As <i>Wall Street Journal</i> sports writer Ben Cohen chronicles in <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/washington-mystics-wnba-best-offense-3pointers-11567025814">this</a> article, the best offensive team in WNBA history, Elana Delle Donne's championship-winning 2019 Washington Mystics, was built around the 3pter.</p>
							<p>Overall, the argument is pretty unassaible: professional teams (and I should add - this includes international teams) increasingly subscribe to Moreyball.</p>
							<h2>Men's College Basketball</h2>
							<p>Even in men's college basketball, the story is really not so different.</p>
							<span class="image main"><img src="images/ncaa_moreyball.jpg" alt="" /></span>
							<p>The above picture was taken from <a href="https://www.ncaa.com/news/basketball-men/article/2019-10-03/how-new-3-point-line-might-affect-college-basketball">this</a> article about the rationale for moving the 3pt line back 22' 1.75'' in the men's college game.</p>
							<p>That's right: the 3pter was becoming so dominant that they actually changed the distance of the 3pt line to make it a more difficult shot!</p>
							<p>Although this rule change may curb the 3pt trend somewhat, my guess is that it won't have a huge effect.</p>
							<p>The dominance of the 3pter will remain - it's just strategic common sense in modern basketball.</p>
							<h2>Women's College Basketball</h2>
							<p>When the men's college basketball rules committee decided to move their 3pt line back, the women's college basketball committee held off.</p>
							<p>But by all accounts, the trend in the women's game is pretty similar to the trend in the men's game: 3pt attempts per game are going up.</p>
							<span class="image main"><img src="images/her_hoop_stats_3pters.png" alt="" /></span>
							<p>The above picture was taken from <a href="https://medium.com/her-hoop-stats/how-is-ncaa-womens-basketball-evolving-e3395a8f8823">this</a> article from <i>Her Hoop Stats</i> about 3pt trends in the women's game.</p>
							<p>Although the trend line is not as steep as the men's, it's still noticable: women are attempting more 3pters than they ever have, and show no signs of slowing down.</p>
							<p>Of course, 3pters attempted and 3pt accuracy depends on the level of play. See the below table from the 2018-2019 season:</p>
							<div class="table-wrapper">
								<table>
									<thead>
										<tr>
											<th></th>
											<th>3PM</th>
											<th>3PA</th>
											<th>3PT%</th>
										</tr>
									</thead>
									<tbody>
										<tr>
											<td>Division I</td>
											<td>6.05*</td>
											<td>19.13*</td>
											<td>31.6%</td>
										</tr>
										<tr>
											<td>Division II</td>
											<td>6.14*</td>
											<td>19.44*</td>
											<td>31.6%</td>
										</tr>
										<tr>
											<td>Division III</td>
											<td>5.53*</td>
											<td>18.70*</td>
											<td>29.6%</td>
									</tbody>
									<tfoot>
										<tr>
											<td><i>*all-time high</i></td>
										</tr>
									</tfoot>								
								</table>
							</div>
							<p>Both 3pt attempts and accuracy are lower in Division III compared to Divisions I & II.</p>
							<p>But that's to be expected: the talent in Division III is worse, and DIII coaches are, in my opinion, a bit more stuck in their ways.</p>
							<p><i>But I'm not stuck in my ways.</i></p>
							<p>And while I can't commit ahead of time to just how many 3pters my team will shoot, I will tell you this: it will be a priority.</p>
							<p>Like I said: to me, prioritizing 3pt shooting and playing "Moreyball" is just a matter of strategic common sense. 
							<p>And I'm a big fan of common sense.</p>
							<h2>Youth Levels</h2>
							<p>Data isn't as abundant at the youth level as it is at the college and professional levels.</p>
							<p>But having watched my fair share of high school and AAU basketball, I can tell you this for sure: Moreyball isn't being prioritized enough.</p>
							<p>There are two aspects of youth basketball in need of improvement that are worth mentioning: shooting mechanics and playing style.</p>
							<h3>Shooting Mechanics</h3>
							<p>One if the problems is that youth athletes are not taught to shoot properly, and ball size and basket height are not adjusted by age as they should be to promote better shooting mechanics.</p>
							<p>A good rule of thumb I've heard is that the height in feet of the basketball hoop should be roughly equal to the age of the youngster shooting on the hoop.</p>
							<p>So an 8-year-old should be shooting on an 8-ft hoop, a 9-year-old should be shooting on a 9-ft hoop, and 10-ft hoops should be reserved for the 10-and-up contingent.</p>
							<p>Making these simple, age-appopriate adjustments would allow youngsters to reach the basket without compromising their shooting form (i.e. without having to chuck the ball at the hoop).</p>
							<p>Something to keep in mind for parents and youth coaches!</p>
							<h3>Playing Style</h3>
							<p>Youth basketball shouldn't be all about winning. That leads to burnout and attrition. Instead, youth basketball should be about having fun. I get that.</p>
							<p>But having fun and learning how to play the game better aren't necessarily mutually exclusive. In fact, under the best circumstances, they go hand-in-hand.</p>
							<p>So I would urge youth coaches to build fun into teaching a Moreyball playing style. That is, after all, what even I would do at the college level - it's called a games approach to coaching.</p>
							<p>Just build-in incentives to shoot 3pters and finish at the basket and voila - you're teaching Moreyball. It's obviously a little more complicated than that, but not by much.</p>
							<p>By all means: don't over-engineer the offense at any youth level. Kids need freedom to explore and play creatively.</p>
							<p>But don't be naive either - Moreyball is here to stay, and the more youth coaches realize that and teach towards it the better.</p>
							<h2>Conclusion</h2>
							<p>Before Daryl Morey, professional basketball teams were negligent - they weren't valuing the 3pt shot as much as they rationally should have been.</p>
							<p>Nowadays, every professional team (men's or women's, international or domestic) is more-or-less caught up to this idea. 3pt shooting is being appropriately valued now more than ever at the professional level.</p>
							<p>But there is still "room to run" for the 3pter at all levels of the college game and certainly in youth basketball - to build skilled basketball players and to play a rational basketball strategy, 3pt shooting needs to be a priority.</p>
							<p>Moreyball is the way of the basketball future - basketball coaches can either get on board or get left behind.</p>
