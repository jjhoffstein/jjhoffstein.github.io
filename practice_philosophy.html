							<h1>My Practice Philosphy</h1>
							<p>Basically, I think practices should be about two things: <b>learning skills and playing games</b>.</p> 
							<p><i>Learning skills</i> means players are improving at their craft.</p>
							<p><i>Playing games</i> means players are competing and having fun.</p>
							<p>Put those two together and players will look forward to coming to practice every day.</p>
							<p>Put those two together and you'll be shocked how fast a team can improve.</p>
							<h2>Skills, not drills.</h2>
							<p>Drills are only effective insofar as they help players improve; that is, insofar as they teach <i>transferable</i> skills.</p>
							<p>A great example of an ineffective basketball drill is three-player-weave: many teams do this drill, but it doesn't actually teach a <i>transferable</i> skill.</p>
							<p>Instead, I think practice time would be better spent on teaching <i>transferable</i> skills, such as shooting, finishing, and/or decision-making.</p>
							<p>And while I do think there's a place for "block practice" and dry reps, my favorite way to teach is through games.</p>
							<h2>A games approach to coaching.</h2>
							<p>Study after study has found the "games approach" to be more effective than other approaches because it maximizes (1) fun, (2) retention and transfer, (3) active learning time, and (4) conditioning.</p>
							<h3>Fun</h3>
							<p>Having fun and "playing with joy" is a thrill to behold. A games-based, competitive practice brings this out in players.</p>
							<p>When players are fun to play with, their teammates often reciprocate. Having fun in the gym injects joy into team members' lives.</p>
							<h3>Retention and Transfer</h3>
							<p>One of my favorite teaching quotes is: <i>about the dangers of fire, the burnt hand learns best.</i> This means that players need to "get burnt" in competitive scenarios to actually learn the lessons they need to learn to be more effective in games.</p>
							<p> If players are failing in practice then players are learning in practice. And learning is the goal.</p>
							<p>You're never going to learn to ski by reading a textbook. Eventually you have to strap on your skiis and hit the slopes.</p>
							<h3>Active Learning Time</h3>
							<p>One thing I hate to see in practice is long lines. Players don't learn when they're in a line, and they don't have fun either. A games approach to coaching keeps players' brains and bodies active throughout practice.</p>
							<h3>Conditioning</h3>
							<p>Higher activity time leads to better conditioning. Workouts are great, but there's only one way to get in basketball shape: by playing basketball.</p>
							<h2>Enter the Stretch Zone.</h2>
							<p>The organization Outward Bound has a concept that is helpful in thinking about the optimal pace of learning: they speak of a Complacency Zone, a Stretch Zone, and a Danger Zone.</p>
							<p>In the Stretch Zone, players' competencies are being stretched & tested, and players are learning through failure via frequent, instantaneous feedback loops.</p>
							<p>A games approach to coaching keeps practices in the Stretch Zone. That's where I want my practices to be.</p>
							<h2>Sample Practice Plan</h2>
							<p>There are lots of different types of practices:
								<ul>
									<li>Early in the season vs. late in the season</li>
									<li>Day before a game vs. day after a game</li>
									<li>Shootaround vs. full practice</li>
									<li>Etc.</li>
								</ul>
							<p>While each practice type is different, below is an example of what a typical <b>skills- and games-focused practice</b> might look like from me:</p>
